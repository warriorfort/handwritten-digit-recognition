# handwritten-digit-recognition

Implemented the backpropagation and feedforward propagation algorithm for neural
networks and applied it to the task of hand-written digit recognition.
Neural network model is trained on set consisting of 5000 images(pixels are represented in form of matrix).

Training Set Accuracy : 95%
